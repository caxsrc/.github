# Computational Approaches to X (CA-X)

Welcome to **Computational Approaches to X** (CA-X)!
This project is dedicated to advancing computational science education
through the development of accessible, practical, and engaging
educational materials.


## Goals

The CA-X project aims to:
* Develop high-quality educational resources focused on computational
  approaches to various scientific and engineering disciplines.
* Bridge the gap between numerical analysis theories and hands-on
  software implementations.
* Empower students, educators, and researchers with tools and
  techniques for solving complex problems using computational methods.

By integrating modern tools, open-source practices, and interactive
resources, CA-X seeks to make computational science education more
impactful.


## Key Features

* **Educational Modules**:
  Modular, topic-specific resources covering computational methods,
  programming, and numerical approaches.

* **Interactive Content**:
  Resources designed to be run and explored interactively using
  [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/),
  [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), or
  [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

* **Open-Source Philosophy**:
  All materials are freely available under an open-source license,
  encouraging collaboration and contribution from the global
  community.


## Current Focus Areas

* **Computational Physics**:
  Techniques for solving differential equations, simulating physical
  systems, and analyzing data.


## How to Get Involved

We welcome contributions and collaboration from anyone passionate
about computational science education.
Whether you are an educator, a student, or a professional, there are
many ways to contribute:

* Submit suggestions or feedback via GitHub Issues, e.g., in
  [`cana`](https://github.com/caxsrc/cana/issues) and
  [`caph`](https://github.com/caxsrc/caph/issues).
* Propose new features or topics through pull requests.
* Share your own computational science resources for integration.

Let's make computational science education accessible and exciting for
everyone!
